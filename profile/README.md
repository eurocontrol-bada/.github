Welcome to the EUROCONTROL’s BADA GitHub repository!

The Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) is an Aircraft Performance Model (APM) developed and maintained by EUROCONTROL with active cooperation of aircraft manufacturers and the BADA users’ community.

The BADA APM is designed for simulation and prediction of aircraft trajectories for purposes of ATM R&D and operations.

It consists of:
<ul>
<li><strong>BADA Model Specification</strong> – document(s) providing aircraft performance theoretical fundaments, algorithms and mathematical models used to calculate aircraft performance parameters.</li>
<li><strong>BADA Aircraft Performance Datasets</strong> - collection of data sets providing aircraft specific coefficients necessary to perform calculations using BADA Model Specifications, aircraft characteristics and other pre-computed aircraft performance parameters.</li>
<li><strong>pyBADA</strong> - python-based implementation of BADA APM including methods to calculate any of the aircraft’s performance characteristics (lift, drag, thrust, fuel flow), operational flight envelope, BADA airline procedure model and calculation of PTF and PTD files. It includes modules to calculate atmospheric properties, unit conversions (including the speed conversion), geodesic calculations and simple trajectory segment calculation.</li>
</ul>

While the <strong>BADA Model Specifications</strong> and <strong>pyBADA</strong> are publicly accessible, the access to the <strong>BADA Aircraft Performance Datasets</strong> is subject to the conclusion of a licence agreement with EUROCONTROL.
